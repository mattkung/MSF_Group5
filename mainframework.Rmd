###Introduction(Marnelia):  
Who we are -> digital marketing consultant  
What we will do -> help our client, Tinder, keeps growing and find monetization opportunity

###Theory : what do you expect to find ? 
For our client , we want to use this dataset to solve 2 main problem?  

#### 1  What does dating app users look like?     
* Is there any characteristic of dating app users?  
* Can we use these characteristic to find our potential users?  
* Besides demographic data, this dataset also has behavioral data.   Can we use these data to improve our app?    
  
#### 2  How can Tinder grow? How can Tinder make money?      
* Where to advertise: social media, online shopping website....?  
* Other advertisement opportunity? We will use gaming and job data to see if these websites or apps can help us to recruit more users?  
* In return, after above strategy, when we have enough user base, we will consider to sell Ads in Tinder app. Can we consider these websites/apps as our potential advertisement buyers? If yes, what kind of data can support our argument?  


### Method:  
####1 Describe the dataset  
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
cupid_data<-read.csv ("./Dataset/June 10-July 12, 2015 - Gaming, Jobs and Broadband - CSV.csv",colClasses = "factor")
# dimension (row*col)
# how many questions in each section
# how the dataset was collected (date and which research house)

```
